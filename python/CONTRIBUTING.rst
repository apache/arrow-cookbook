Building the Python Cookbook
===========================

The python cookbook uses the Sphinx documentation system.

Running ``make py`` from the cookbook root directory (the one where
the ``README.rst`` exists) will install all necessary dependencies
and will compile the cookbook to HTML.

You will see the compiled result inside the ``build/py`` directory.

Testing Python Recipes
======================

All recipes in the cookbook must be tested. The cookbook uses
``doctest`` to verify the recipes.

Running ``make pytest`` from the cookbook root directory
will verify that the code for all the recipes runs correctly
and provides the expected output.

If the environment variable ``ARROW_NIGHTLY`` is set to ``1``
the cookbooks will be run against the latest development version of
Arrow published by the `Nightly jobs. <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/install.html#installing-nightly-packages>`_

Example to run the cookbooks using the nightly jobs:

```
$ ARROW_NIGHTLY=1
$ make pytest
```

Adding Python Recipes
=====================

The recipes are written in **reStructuredText** format using 
the `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ documentation system.

New recipes can be added to one of the existing ``.rst`` files if
they suit that section or you can create new sections by adding
additional ``.rst`` files in the ``source`` directory. You just
need to remember to add them to the ``index.rst`` file in the
``toctree`` for them to become visible.

The only requirement for recipes is that each code block in the recipe 
must be written using the ``.. testcode::`` directive, 
so that it can get tested.

If the code block changes, alters or creates data, the recipe should
``print`` the data to show how it changed and have a ``.. testoutput::``
directive to confirm that the printed data is the expected one.

For example a new recipe about how to create an Arrow array
might look like:

.. code-block::

    You can create a new :class:`pyarrow.Array` providing the
    data for the array through the :meth:`pyarrow.array` factory function

    .. testcode::

        import pyarrow as pa
        array = pa.array(range(5))
        print(array)

    .. testoutput::

        [
          0,
          1,
          2,
          3,
          4
        ]

If you refer to any ``pyarrow`` class, function or method using
``:class:``, ``:meth:`` or ``:func:`` directives a link to their
documentation in the pyarrow API reference will be automatically
created.
