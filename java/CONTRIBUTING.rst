Bulding the Java Cookbook
=========================

The java cookbook uses the Sphinx documentation system.

Running ``make j`` from the cookbook root directory (the one where
the ``README.rst`` exists) will install all necessary dependencies
and will compile the cookbook to HTML.

You will see the compiled result inside the ``build/j`` directory.

Testing Java Recipes
====================

This is WIP and need to define a way to test recipes provided to validate
output expected.

Adding Java Recipes
===================

The recipes are written in **reStructuredText** format using 
the `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ documentation system.

New recipes can be added to one of the existing ``.rst`` files if
they suit that section or you can create new sections by adding
additional ``.rst`` files in the ``source`` directory. You just
need to remember to add them to the ``index.rst`` file in the
``toctree`` for them to become visible.
