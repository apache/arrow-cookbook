# Reading and Writing Data

Recipes related to reading and writing data from disk using Apache Arrow.

## Write a Parquet file

Given an array with all numbers from 0 to 100

```{r, write_parquet}

```
```{r, test_write_parquet, opts.label = "test"}

```
 
To write it to a Parquet file, as Parquet is a columnar format,
we must create a :class:`pyarrow.Table` out of it,
so that we get a table of a single column which can then be
written to a Parquet file.
 
Once we have a table, it can be written to a Parquet File 
using the functions provided by the ``pyarrow.parquet`` module


## Reading a Parquet file

Given a Parquet file, it can be read back to a :class:`pyarrow.Table`
by using :func:`pyarrow.parquet.read_table` function

```{r, read_parquet}

```
```{r, test_read_parquet, opts.label = "test"}

```


The resulting table will contain the same columns that existed in
the parquet file as :class:`ChunkedArray`
