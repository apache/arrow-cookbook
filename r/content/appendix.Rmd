## R data type to Arrow data type mapping {#r2arrow}

| R type                   | Arrow type |
|--------------------------|------------|
| logical                  | boolean    |
| integer                  | int32      |
| double ("numeric")       | float64^1^ |
| character                | utf8^2^    |
| factor                   | dictionary |
| raw                      | uint8      |
| Date                     | date32     |
| POSIXct                  | timestamp  |
| POSIXlt                  | struct     |
| data.frame               | struct     |
| list^3^                  | list       |
| bit64::integer64         | int64      |
| difftime                 | time32     |
| vctrs::vctrs_unspecified | null       |


^1^: `float64` and `double` are the same concept and data type in Arrow C++; 
however, only `float64()` is used in arrow as the function `double()` already exists in base R

^2^: If the character vector exceeds 2GB of strings, it will be converted to a 
`large_utf8` Arrow type

^3^: Only lists where all elements are the same type are able to be translated 
to Arrow list type (which is a "list of" some type).

^1^: These integer types may contain values that exceed the range of R's 
`integer` type (32-bit signed integer). When they do, `uint32` and `uint64` are 
converted to `double` ("numeric") and `int64` is converted to 
`bit64::integer64`. This conversion can be disabled (so that `int64` always
yields a `bit64::integer64` vector) by setting `options(arrow.int64_downcast = FALSE)`.

^2^: Due to the limitation of R factors, Arrow `dictionary` values are coerced
to string when translated to R if they are not already strings.

^3^: `arrow*_binary` classes are implemented as lists of raw vectors. 

^4^: `arrow*_list` classes are implemented as subclasses of `vctrs_list_of` 
with a `ptype` attribute set to what an empty Array of the value type converts to.
