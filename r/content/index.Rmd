# Preface

![](images/arrow.png "Apache Arrow logo")

This cookbook aims to provide a number of recipes showing how to perform common 
tasks using [arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/).  This version of the 
cookbook works with arrow >= 6.0.0, but in future we will maintain different 
versions for the last few major R package releases.

## What is Arrow?

Apache Arrow is a cross-language development platform for in-memory analytics.  
The arrow R package provides a low-level interface to much of the functionality 
available in the C++ implementation, as well as a higher-level interface to the
compute functionality via an implementation of the [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) API.

## Alternative resources

For a complete reference guide to the functions in arrow, as well as vignettes, 
see [the pkgdown site](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/).

If you have any requests for new recipes, please open a ticket via 
[the cookbook's GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/apache/arrow-cookbook/issues).

If you have any Arrow feature requests to make or bugs to report, please 
[open an issue on the project JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ARROW/issues)
