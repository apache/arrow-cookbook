# Manipulate Data



## Manipulate and analyze Arrow data with dplyr verbs 
## Using simple mathematical and statistical function 
## Work with character data (stringr functions and Arrow functions)
## Work with datetime data (lubridate functions)

### Extracting date components

If you want to extract individual components from a date, you can use the following functions that mimic the behaviour of the equivalent `lubridate` functions:

* `year`
* `isoyear`
* `quarter`
* `month`
* `day`
* `wday`
* `yday`
* `isoweek`
* `hour`
* `minute`
* `second`

```{r, extract_week}

```

## Call an Arrow compute function which doesn't yet have an R binding
## Access and manipulate Arrow objects through low-level bindings to the C++ library
